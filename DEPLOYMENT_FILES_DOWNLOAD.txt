📁 NUTRITAME - DEPLOYMENT FILES INSTRUCTIONS

🎯 YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD 4 FILES FOR HOSTINGER:

FILES TO CREATE ON DESKTOP:
==========================

1. index.html (3.6KB)
2. _redirects (18 bytes) 
3. static/css/main.36391484.css (87KB)
4. static/js/main.c59f01ff.js (569KB)

FOLDER STRUCTURE ON DESKTOP:
===========================
NutriTame_Deploy/
├── index.html
├── _redirects
└── static/
    ├── css/
    │   └── main.36391484.css
    └── js/
        └── main.c59f01ff.js

PROBLEM: Files 3 & 4 are too large to copy manually from this interface.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
====================
Instead of manual copy/paste, you can:
1. Use Hostinger File Manager's UPLOAD feature
2. Upload the entire /app/frontend/build folder contents
3. This includes all files automatically

HOSTINGER UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:
=============================
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to public_html/app/
4. Delete existing files in that directory
5. Upload all contents from the build folder
6. Make sure folder structure is maintained
