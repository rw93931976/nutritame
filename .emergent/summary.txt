The trajectory details an extensive and often frustrating debugging process for the NutriTame application, primarily focused on resolving critical s, state transition issues, and API endpoint mismatches that prevented the complete demo user flow. The AI engineer and user (Ray) engaged in multiple rounds of fixes, ranging from  logic and  timeouts to correcting API calls in  and . A significant challenge was the user's manual Hostinger deployment workflow and the AI's initial misdiagnosis or contradictory instructions regarding API endpoints (FastAPI vs. PHP, and then double  prefixes). Debugging evolved from focusing on  to browser console analysis revealing 404 errors for  and  calls. The AI addressed these, but the session concluded with a critical regression: after the final upload, the entire site failed, displaying only a blue page. The user expressed high frustration, leading to a request for a comprehensive summary before forking the conversation.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a multi-tenant SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 1, 2025 launch. It is designed to include an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and planned Stripe integration. Key features already implemented or in progress include user profile management, functional navigation, an enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX, a functional medical disclaimer, an in-app Demo Countdown Timer with session tracking, and full mobile responsiveness. The immediate problem addressed in this trajectory was a critical  blocking application build and deployment, and subsequent issues preventing the complete demo user flow. The explicit goal was to ensure a seamless transition from the medical disclaimer, through the demo landing page, to the main application interface (profile setup form) after successful demo user creation on the Hostinger-deployed React frontend and PHP/MySQL backend.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), PHP (backend, converted from FastAPI), MySQL (database).
-   **Deployment**: Hostinger (target environment).
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
-   **API Integration**: Emergentintegrations (LLM), Google Places/Maps.
-   **Authentication**: JWT.
-   **Build Tool**: .

<code_architecture>

-   
    -   **Importance**: Central React component managing global state, routing, and main event handlers.
    -   **Changes**: Initially debugged for a  and  logic. The AI later provided a full  replacement, but the user reported it broke the code, so the intended fixes for  were not definitively applied locally.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Displays and manages user interaction with the medical disclaimer.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  for scroll detection from 100ms to 500ms and added a retry mechanism () to address issues where the disclaimer acceptance button remained disabled in the production environment due to timing.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for demo users, handling Start Free Demo Now button and initial API calls for demo user creation and configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple revisions. Initially, API calls were adjusted to . Later, the AI attempted to change endpoints to FastAPI-style (, ), then reverted. Most recently, the crucial fix involved removing a duplicate  prefix from both  calls, correcting them from  to  (and the  variant), as the  variable already included the base  path.
-   
    -   **Importance**: The main public landing page, displaying product information and calls to action.
    -   **Changes**:
        - Removed a  block that was making a  call to , which was consistently returning a 404 error. This was replaced with a hardcoded  object to provide default values and prevent loading failures.
        - Modified  handlers for five different Get Started and Start Trial buttons to correctly pass the  parameter () to the  function in , ensuring proper navigation.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables, specifically  for API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**:  was configured to . The AI briefly suggested changing it to , but the user clarified their deployment required the Hostinger URL, which was then confirmed as correct and kept.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Acts as a centralized, multi-purpose PHP API endpoint for demo-related functionalities.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented a  statement to handle various  query parameters for demo , , , , and  requests. This backend endpoint was confirmed as functional when tested with empty email for demo access.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Restore Site Functionality**: The application currently shows only a blue page after the latest deployment, requiring immediate debugging and resolution.
-   **Verify Demo Flow**: Once the site is restored, confirm the complete demo flow (Disclaimer → Landing Page → Demo Landing Page → Profile Setup) works as intended.
-   **Backend Demo Access Email Bug**: Investigate and fix the backend's  endpoint, which currently fails when an email address is provided.
-   Future Product Enhancements: Full Admin Tools, Main Website Integration, GDPR & HIPAA Compliance, Comprehensive Documentation, and other planned feature enhancements.

<current_work>
The immediate work culminated in a critical regression: the entire NutriTame application now displays only a blank blue page on Hostinger, failing to load any content, including the medical disclaimer. This occurred after the user rebuilt their local frontend and uploaded the  contents to  on Hostinger. Prior to this, extensive debugging focused on correcting API endpoint mismatches and non-functional navigation. Specifically, the AI had recently instructed the user to:
1.  **Modify **:
    *   Removed a  fetching  (which was causing 404s) and replaced it with a hardcoded  object.
    *   Updated  handlers for five Get Started and Start Trial buttons to  to correctly trigger the demo flow.
2.  **Modify **:
    *   Corrected both API  calls from  to  (and the  version) to remove the erroneous double  prefix.
The user confirmed making these changes locally and rebuilding before the final upload. The backend's PHP endpoints ( and ) were verified to be working correctly with *empty* email addresses during demo access testing. The current state is a completely non-functional frontend, leading to significant user frustration and a need to revert/diagnose the site's blank state.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to diagnose and resolve the critical regression causing the blue page site failure, then restore the application to a functional state.
