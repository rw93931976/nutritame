The trajectory details the debugging and deployment of the NutriTame application for a non-technical user. The previous AI engineer successfully resolved a critical blue page deployment issue on Hostinger and a display bug in the shopping list feature. Initial attempts to migrate to Vercel were rolled back, solidifying Hostinger as the target environment. The primary challenge transitioned to facilitating manual file transfers for deployment due to the user's limited technical expertise and Hostinger's manual process, which was exacerbated by large minified build files. The conversation highlights the AI's iterative approach, problem-solving for specific UI/API issues, and continuous adaptation to user constraints and feedback regarding the deployment method. The most recent task involved providing individual build files for manual upload, where the AI struggled with content truncation of large files.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. It aims to offer an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and Stripe integration, with existing features including user profile management, navigation, enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX, a medical disclaimer, and a Demo Countdown Timer. The immediate problems addressed were a critical  preventing application build/deployment on Hostinger (blue page issue) and issues hindering the complete demo user flow. The explicit goal was to ensure a seamless demo experience from medical disclaimer to profile setup, with functional AI chat, restaurant search, and shopping list generation. The application is to be deployed on Hostinger via manual file upload.

Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the NutriTame application and fixed a critical bug. The initial blue page site failure on Hostinger was resolved through various frontend configuration fixes, allowing the app to load. All core demo functionalities are now fully operational in the preview environment (). This includes the medical disclaimer, seamless navigation through landing pages, successful demo user creation and profile submission (using mock data), and functional mock responses for the AI Health Coach and restaurant search.

A significant achievement was identifying and fixing a display bug in the shopping list feature. Previously, lists were generated but appeared empty. The AI discovered that the  component in  was attempting to access  and  instead of the correct  and  properties. These property references were corrected, and the frontend was successfully rebuilt. This new working state, including the shopping list fix, has been saved as a rollback version .

The immediate task has been to provide the user with the built frontend files for manual deployment to Hostinger. The AI has successfully provided  and  as plain text. However, when attempting to provide the  (87KB) and  (569KB) files, the content was truncated or deemed too large for the manual copy/paste method. The user reported not receiving the full CSS content, indicating a continued challenge in the manual deployment process.
