The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's efforts to debug and deploy the NutriTame application to Hostinger. Initially, the AI resolved a critical blue page deployment error and a shopping list display bug by correcting property names in , establishing a stable  state. The subsequent challenge was the manual transfer of large build files (CSS, JS) for Hostinger. The AI initially employed a chunking strategy, providing JS chunks 1-15 out of 38. This approach was superseded by the user's request to use a GitHub-based workflow. After facing GitHub authentication issues preventing direct pushes and archiving limitations, the user utilized a Save to GitHub feature. The AI then provided comprehensive instructions for the user to download the latest  codebase from GitHub, build it locally, and deploy the resulting  folder to Hostinger. The conversation concludes with the user having the necessary instructions for self-deployment.

The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its core features include an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and Stripe integration. Currently implemented features encompass user profile management, navigation, an enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX, a medical disclaimer, and a Demo Countdown Timer. The immediate problem addressed was a critical  (the blue page issue) preventing application build/deployment on Hostinger and a display bug in the shopping list feature, hindering the complete demo user flow. The explicit goal was to ensure a seamless demo experience from medical disclaimer to profile setup, with functional AI chat, restaurant search, and correctly displaying shopping list generation. All these demo functionalities have been stabilized and are working as expected. The application is to be deployed on Hostinger via manual file upload, using a GitHub-download-and-local-build strategy for the latest  working version.

Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer had successfully stabilized the NutriTame application, resolving a critical blue page deployment failure and a shopping list display bug ( to ,  to  in ). This ensured all core demo functionalities were operational, and this stable state was recorded as . The primary task shifted to enabling the user to deploy these working files to Hostinger. Initial attempts involved chunking large JavaScript and CSS build files for manual copy-pasting, with 15 JS chunks provided. However, this approach was superseded by the user's preference to download the source code from GitHub, build it locally, and then upload the  folder via FTP. The AI attempted to push the latest code to GitHub but was blocked by authentication issues and also failed to create a ZIP archive. The problem was ultimately resolved by the user utilizing a Save to GitHub feature within their interface, successfully committing the latest  working version to a new GitHub branch. The AI has now provided the user with clear, step-by-step instructions to download this specific branch from GitHub, perform a local build ( then ), and finally upload the contents of the resulting  directory to their Hostinger FTP. The application's source, including all fixes, is now accessible to the user on GitHub for self-deployment.
