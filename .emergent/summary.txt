The trajectory chronicles an iterative development process to stabilize and enhance the NutriTame AI Health Coach. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical bugs in the disclaimer flow, where user input was lost and messages failed silently. This involved consolidating state management, unifying message sending through , and implementing a robust auto-resume mechanism across versions  to .

Following , the AI engineer tackled  to fix a  related to session handling, enforced -only consent gating, and implemented  for error resilience.  aimed to add UX polish (input clear, user echo, toast, auto-scroll) to the resume flow, which initially failed to trigger reliably. This led to , where a  helper was introduced to force these UX elements, along with a double-send guard and a chat panel height adjustment, ensuring a seamless and visually responsive user experience.

NutriTame is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an Oct 2025 launch, featuring an AI Health Coach utilizing OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. The initial critical problem was a Question Persistence bug where user input vanished after medical disclaimer acceptance, and subsequent send attempts failed.

User requirements throughout the trajectory included:
1.  **Core Bug Fixes**: Resolve input rehydration and post-accept send functionality, demanding comprehensive instrumentation, rollback checkpoints, and validation.
2.  **Session & Gating Fixes (v2.2.9)**: Address already thinking locks, , inconsistent  states, and ensure reliable auto-resume. This involved replacing incorrect session variables, adding , wrapping send flows in , and enforcing  as the single source of truth for consent gating.
3.  **UX Polish (v2.2.10)**: Visually clarify auto-resume by clearing input, echoing user messages immediately, auto-scrolling/refocusing, and displaying a one-shot Your question was sent toast after consent.
4.  **Forced UX & Stability (v2.2.11)**: Ensure 's UX elements reliably fire (especially in incognito mode). This required a new  helper, direct invocation from the accept handler, a guard against accidental double-sends, and a slightly taller chat panel.
The overarching goal was a stable, production-ready application with a seamless user experience for AI interactions and proper disclaimer gating.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented version  for the NutriTame AI Health Coach. This release focused on forcing and refining the user experience during the auto-resume flow post-disclaimer acceptance, addressing previous reports that UX elements were not reliably triggering.

Key aspects of the  work include:
1.  **Forced Resume UX Helper**: A new  helper function was created within . This function is now responsible for directly executing all required UX actions—clearing the input field, echoing the user's message into the chat transcript, displaying a 5-second green toast notification, focusing the input, and scrolling the chat to the bottom—before initiating the API call via .
2.  **Direct Disclaimer Handler Integration**: The  wrapper (within ) was updated to directly call  when a pending message is present after consent, replacing the previous indirect  call.
3.  **Double-Send Prevention**: A  state and an associated guard were added to the  function. This prevents accidental duplicate message submissions if the user habitually presses Enter again within approximately 300ms after an auto-resume.
4.  **UI Layout Adjustment**: The chat panel's height was increased from  to  (an additional 80 pixels) to provide a visually roomier and more comfortable transcript area.

All previous invariants, such as the single message sending path (), -based consent gating (), pending question storage (), and existing logging formats, were meticulously preserved. The final step was to generate a manual QA guide () and prepare the fork summary ().
