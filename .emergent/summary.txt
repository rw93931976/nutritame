The previous AI engineerâ€™s work focused on iteratively stabilizing and enhancing the NutriTame AI Health Coach's disclaimer and auto-resume flow. Initially, the project addressed Question Persistence and session management bugs, progressing to UX polish (v2.2.10-v2.2.13) by centralizing message sending via  and .

The latest phase tackled critical issues with the unified sender: legacy paths interfering, session creation failures (422/400 errors), and CORS. The engineer surgically refactored  for robust session and message handling (user_id in POST body, correct API contract), fixed backend CORS in , and aimed to guarantee the unified sender's availability by bootstrapping it in . While the backend API contract and CORS issues were successfully resolved and validated, a persistent problem emerged where the  bootstrap code fails to execute, preventing the unified sender from being globally available. This frontend JavaScript execution problem is the current blocking issue, despite all backend and API contract aspects being correct.

NutriTame is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics launching in Oct 2025, featuring an AI Health Coach (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini). The core problem addressed was a Question Persistence bug where user input vanished after medical disclaimer acceptance and subsequent sends failed.

User requirements evolved through several phases:
1.  **Core Bug Fixes (v2.2.4-v2.2.8)**: Resolve input rehydration and post-accept send, requiring instrumentation and validation.
2.  **Session & Gating Fixes (v2.2.9)**: Address already thinking locks, , inconsistent  states, and ensure auto-resume using / and  for consent.
3.  **UX Polish (v2.2.10)**: Clear input, echo user messages, auto-scroll/refocus, and display a Your question was sent toast post-consent.
4.  **Forced UX & Stability (v2.2.11)**: Ensure UX elements reliably fire (incognito mode) using , double-send guards.
5.  **Unified Accept & Legacy Path Removal (v2.2.12-v2.2.13)**: Wire all consent Accept buttons to a single  handler, remove all legacy paths, and ensure  is called.
6.  **Unified Sender & API Contract Fixes (Latest)**:
    *   Eliminate legacy  and route all sends through a unified sender.
    *   Fix session creation: use real  (from ) in  *request body* (not query param).
    *   Resolve CORS errors (frontend  to backend ).
    *   Guarantee the unified sender exists **before** any consent fires (e.g., via  bootstrap).

-   
    -   **Importance**: Central React application logic. Manages routing, global state, chat interfaces (Dashboard, CoachInterface), API interactions, and disclaimer.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Evolved significantly to unify disclaimer acceptance (single ), remove legacy resume paths, and implement a robust  function. Latest changes involved removing previous  logic, replacing it with calls to a new  for session/message handling, and integrating UI status indicators. Crucially, the  that exposed  from the CoachInterface was removed to support a global bootstrap in .

    -   **Importance**: React application entry point.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Modified to attempt bootstrapping a global  function, aiming to guarantee its availability before any component renders. This function handles user ID resolution, session creation, and message sending via , including disclaimer acceptance logic. This is the current point of failure, as the JS in this file isn't executing.

    -   **Importance**: New file centralizing Axios API calls for the AI Coach features.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Created to encapsulate  instance, , , , and . It was iteratively refined to:
        *   Accept  in the POST body for .
        *   Include session ID caching.
        *   Initial complex instrumentation for  was simplified to directly use the confirmed  body format.

    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend routes and logic.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        *   Updated  Pydantic model to include .

    -   **Importance**: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Summary of changes**:  was updated to explicitly include  and , moving from a wildcard  origin.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical bug in the AI Coach flow. The problem stemmed from two main issues:
1.  **Legacy sender interference**: Despite previous efforts, a legacy sending path () was still occasionally firing, causing  errors due to incorrect payload structure.
2.  **Session creation failure**: The unified path's call to  was returning a  or , indicating an API contract mismatch, and CORS preflight requests were failing.

The work involved a multi-pronged approach:
-   **Backend API Contract Fix**: The  was modified to update the  Pydantic model and the  endpoint to correctly expect and parse the  from the *request body* () instead of a query parameter. This was validated by the backend testing agent as fully functional.
-   **CORS Configuration**: The  file was updated to specifically allow  and  in .
-   **Unified Sender Centralization ()**: The  file was streamlined. It now contains  which directly uses the confirmed  POST body, removing previous instrumentation attempts, and  for caching.
-   **Legacy Path Elimination ()**: The  handler in  was simplified to *only* call . References to  and  were removed or disabled within  and .
-   **Bootstrap Unified Sender ()**: A critical attempt was made to guarantee the  function's availability by defining it directly in , ensuring it runs at application bootstrap, before any React component renders. This  was also updated to include logic for calling  first, if needed, before attempting session creation.

**Current State and Nuance**: All backend API contract issues (400/422 for sessions, CORS) have been successfully resolved and verified by the backend testing agent. However, a significant frontend issue persists: the JavaScript code added to  for bootstrapping  is *not executing at all*, as evidenced by a complete lack of console logs from  and  remaining . This prevents the unified sending flow from being fully realized in the frontend.
