The trajectory chronicles an intense debugging and deployment journey for the NutriTame application, initially plagued by a blue page site failure on Hostinger. The AI engineer navigated various critical issues, including s related to  compatibility on Node 22, API endpoint mismatches (e.g., double  prefixes, missing  extensions), and state management for  and .

A significant challenge was the user's manual Hostinger deployment process and the need for explicit, step-by-step guidance. The AI initially attempted a Vercel migration due to persistent Hostinger issues, creating Vercel-specific API routes with mock data. However, this was quickly rolled back when the user reported further failures and requested a return to the last known working Hostinger configuration.

The core strategy shifted to stabilizing the Hostinger environment, primarily by updating frontend configurations and implementing comprehensive mock API responses in PHP for demo features (AI chat, restaurant search, profile submission). This allowed the full demo flow to become functional in a preview environment, resolving the blue page and critical navigation issues. The final interaction focuses on preparing the working build files for manual Hostinger deployment, addressing a minor issue with shopping list display, and establishing a clear rollback point.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a multi-tenant SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, aiming for an October 1, 2025 launch. It is intended to feature an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and Stripe integration. Key existing or in-progress features include user profile management, navigation, an enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX, a functional medical disclaimer, an in-app Demo Countdown Timer, and full mobile responsiveness.

The immediate problem tackled was a critical  blocking application build and deployment on Hostinger, and subsequent issues preventing the complete demo user flow. The explicit goal was to ensure a seamless transition from the medical disclaimer, through the landing pages, to the main application interface (profile setup form) after successful demo user creation. Further work involved making AI chat, restaurant search, and shopping list generation functional within the demo environment.

    -   **Importance**: Central React component handling routing, global state, and core application logic (e.g., , , , , ).
    -   **Changes**: Initially debugged for . Later,  was adjusted to call mock demo config/access.  was extensively refactored to use the demo access endpoint for profile creation/update with mock data.  and  were updated to include  headers and utilize mock responses. The  component was modified to correctly receive  and  as props, resolving 'undefined' errors.  state and its setters were passed as props to the  and  components to enable proper state management for shopping list generation.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Manages the medical disclaimer display and acceptance.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  for scroll detection from 100ms to 500ms and added a  mechanism to ensure the accept button is enabled, especially in production.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Handles the demo entry point, initiating demo user creation and configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected API  calls from  to  (and the  variant) to remove erroneous double  prefixes. Later, calls were updated to point to a mock backend in the preview environment.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main public landing page, displaying product information and calls to action.
    -   **Changes**: Removed a  making a  call to  (which caused 404s) and replaced it with a hardcoded  object.  handlers for Get Started and Start Trial buttons were fixed to correctly pass the  parameter.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables, primarily  and .
    -   **Changes**: Configured  to  for Hostinger, then temporarily to a Vercel preview URL, and finally reverted to Hostinger.

    -   **Importance**: Acts as a mock backend for demo-related functionalities, particularly , , and .
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to simulate demo configurations and user access/profile updates with mock data when the real backend was problematic or unavailable (e.g., in the preview environment). Includes a switch statement for different endpoints.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Handles user profile creation and management.
    -   **Changes**: Initially debugged for Internal server error. Simplified to create/update demo users, but largely bypassed by frontend logic pointing to mock  due to persistent backend issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Shopping List Display Fix**: The application creates shopping lists, but their display is currently empty in the UI.
-   **Backend Demo Access Email Bug**: The  endpoint currently fails when an email address is provided. (Addressed by mocking, but underlying issue persists for real backend)
-   **Future Product Enhancements**: Full Admin Tools, Main Website Integration, GDPR & HIPAA Compliance, Comprehensive Documentation, and other planned feature enhancements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully resolved several critical issues and established a functional demo environment. The blue page problem on Hostinger was addressed by fixing frontend build configurations (correcting API URLs and  prop passing in ).

The core demo user flow now works perfectly in the preview environment (). This includes:
1.  **Medical Disclaimer**: Loads, is interactive, and accepts input.
2.  **Landing Page**: Navigates correctly to the demo flow.
3.  **Demo Access**: Successfully creates a demo user (using mock data in the preview environment).
4.  **Profile Submission**: The profile form can be filled out and submitted without network errors (using mock data).
5.  **AI Health Coach**: Responds with diabetes-specific meal planning advice (mocked).
6.  **Restaurant Search**: Returns diabetic-friendly restaurant details (mocked).

The AI had attempted a Vercel deployment, but due to API endpoint mismatches (e.g.,  extensions vs. Vercel's clean URLs), this was rolled back. The current stable state is configured for Hostinger.

A rollback checkpoint (v1.0-working-rollback) has been created to ensure this stable version can be retrieved. The user reported one minor issue: while the list view for shopping lists is created, it has no items or words on it, indicating a UI-specific display bug rather than a generation issue. The immediate task is to provide the user with the files for manual upload to Hostinger.
