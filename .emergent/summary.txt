The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's iterative journey to resolve critical bugs in the NutriTame AI Health Coach, marked by repeated fix attempts and user feedback. Initially, the focus was on a recurring input persistence and silent send failure bug, attributed to excessive  re-mounting. The AI engineer implemented TDD, extensive logging, , , and temporarily disabled , improving component stability. However, an  state transition issue persisted due to a duplicate disclaimer handler. After fixing this, a severe Babel compilation error () blocked the application entirely. Attempts to fix this (removing nested , temporarily disabling ESLint) failed. The process concluded with a user-requested rollback to a previous stable state (), successfully restoring the application to a compilable and runnable baseline.

<product_requirements>
NutriTame is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its central feature is an AI Health Coach that offers compliant, personalized nutritional guidance using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, including conversation history and medical disclaimers. The application incorporates plan gating (Standard/Premium) and requires a high-quality UI/UX. The primary problem addressed in this trajectory was a critical Question Persistence bug: user input disappeared after medical disclaimer acceptance, and subsequent send attempts failed to yield an AI response. The user explicitly requested fixes for input rehydration and post-accept send, demanding comprehensive instrumentation, rollback checkpoints, and validation. The overarching goal is a stable, production-ready application that reliably handles user input and AI interactions with proper disclaimer gating.

A  scope error was fixed. A critical issue with  state not transitioning due to a duplicate inline handler was resolved by refactoring to use a shared  prop. A version banner was introduced. Attempts to add a debug harness and fix compilation errors led to breaking changes, necessitating a rollback. The file is currently reverted to a state similar to commit .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to fix a critical Babel compilation error () in . This error prevented the React app from loading, displaying You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. This compilation issue arose after several attempts to implement a comprehensive debug harness and fix a persistent problem where the medical disclaimer  state was not properly transitioning to  after user acceptance, despite numerous previous fixes for component re-mounting and data persistence.

The AI engineer made multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve the compilation error, including removing nested  blocks, temporarily disabling ESLint in  and with  comments, and restructuring  calls. As these efforts failed to restore compilation, the user instructed a rollback to a known-good commit. The AI engineer successfully rolled back the frontend to commit  (previously tagged ), which fixed the compilation error. The application now compiles and loads, and successfully reaches the AI Coach disclaimer screen. A  was created to document this state.
