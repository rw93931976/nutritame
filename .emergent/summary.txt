The trajectory details the debugging and deployment of the NutriTame application. Initially, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical blue page deployment issue on Hostinger and a display bug in the shopping list feature by correcting property names ( to ,  to ) within . This ensured all core demo functionalities were operational. The primary challenge then shifted to the logistical hurdle of manual file transfer for Hostinger deployment, as large build files (CSS, JS) were truncated when provided as single blocks of text. After explicit user feedback to fix this now, the AI adopted a chunking strategy. It split the large  (569KB) into 38 manageable 15KB chunks and the CSS file into 6 chunks. The current work involves systematically providing these JavaScript chunks to the user for manual reassembly, with 15 chunks delivered and the user prepared for the next batch.

The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its core features aim to include an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and Stripe integration. Currently implemented features encompass user profile management, navigation, an enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX, a medical disclaimer, and a Demo Countdown Timer. The immediate problem addressed was a critical  preventing application build/deployment on Hostinger (the blue page issue) and issues hindering the complete demo user flow. The explicit goal was to ensure a seamless demo experience from medical disclaimer to profile setup, with functional AI chat, restaurant search, and correctly displaying shopping list generation. The application is to be deployed on Hostinger via manual file upload, necessitating a robust file transfer solution.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the NutriTame application. A critical blue page deployment failure on Hostinger was resolved through various frontend configuration fixes, allowing the application to load. All core demo functionalities are now fully operational in the preview environment (). This includes the medical disclaimer, seamless navigation, successful demo user creation and profile submission (using mock data), and functional mock responses for the AI Health Coach and restaurant search.

A significant achievement was identifying and fixing a display bug in the shopping list feature. Previously, lists were generated but appeared empty. The AI discovered that the  component in  was attempting to access  and  instead of the correct  and  properties. These property references were corrected, and the frontend was successfully rebuilt. This new working state, including the shopping list fix, has been saved as a rollback version .

The immediate task has been to provide the user with the built frontend files for manual deployment to Hostinger. The AI successfully provided  and  as plain text. However, initial attempts to provide the  (87KB) and  (569KB) files resulted in content truncation due to their size. To overcome this, the AI has implemented a solution to split these large files into smaller, manageable chunks. The CSS file has been split into 6 chunks, and the JavaScript file into 38 chunks (approximately 15KB each). The current activity involves systematically providing these JavaScript chunks to the user in batches of 5. As of the last message, 15 JavaScript chunks have been provided (Steps 1, 2, and 3 completed), and the user is ready to receive the next batch (Chunks 16-20) to continue assembling the full  file on their desktop.

Provide the next 5 JavaScript chunks (16-20 of 38) to the user for assembly.
