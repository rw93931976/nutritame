The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on resolving a critical, recurring bug in the NutriTame AI Health Coach: input text disappearing post-disclaimer acceptance and silent send failures, despite previous production-ready claims. The process adopted a TDD Red-Green-Refactor approach. Initially, the AI engineer created a failing E2E test, then made several fixes in  to ensure  was the single source of truth for disclaimer , moved the disclaimer modal into , and adjusted  initialization to allow typing before the modal appears.

While the E2E test partially passed, the user reported the bug persisted. This prompted the AI engineer to implement extensive  instrumentation logs across the frontend. Through manual QA and analysis of these logs, the true root cause was finally identified: **excessive component re-mounting of the **, leading to input state loss and broken rehydration, even though the data persistence logic was otherwise correct. The trajectory concludes with a comprehensive summary (FORK_SUMMARY_V8.md) outlining this discovery and clear next steps to address the re-mounting issue.

NutriTame is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its core feature is an AI Health Coach providing compliant, gated, and personalized nutritional guidance using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, including conversation history and medical disclaimers. The application supports plan gating (Standard/Premium) and requires a polished UI/UX.

Previous development focused on resolving critical UX/data persistence bugs. The most recent recurring problem, central to this trajectory, was Question Persistence: user input disappeared after medical disclaimer acceptance, and subsequent send attempts yielded no AI response, despite prior fixes. The user explicitly demanded a fix for input rehydration and post-accept send, requiring forced instrumentation logs to confirm behavior, rollback checkpoints, and validation evidence. The ultimate goal is a stable, production-ready application that correctly handles user input and AI interactions with proper disclaimer gating.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported critical bug where, despite previous claims of resolution, the AI Coach's input text still disappeared after accepting the medical disclaimer, and no AI response was received upon sending. This work followed a TDD approach with strict requirements.

The process involved:
1.  **E2E Test Creation (RED)**: A Playwright test () and GitHub Actions workflow () were created to validate the end-to-end flow.
2.  **Initial Fixes (GREEN attempts)**:
    *   The  component in  was modified to always render , removing its blocking disclaimer modal.
    *   The disclaimer modal logic was moved into the  component, conditional on the  state.
    *   The  state initialization was adjusted to allow users to type *before* the modal appeared on send.
    *    was added to AI message rendering for E2E test targeting.
    *   The E2E test's API interception was refined to be more specific.
    *   These changes led to the E2E test passing most steps, except for the final input clearing.
3.  **Comprehensive Instrumentation**: Following the user's updated prompt, extensive  logs were added throughout  to instrument lifecycle events, input changes,  operations, disclaimer gating, rehydration attempts, and the send flow (, , , , , , ).
4.  **Root Cause Identification**: Through manual QA and analysis of the new instrumentation logs, the critical bug's root cause was identified as excessive component re-mounting of the , which was causing the loss of input state despite logically correct data persistence and rehydration.
The work concluded with the creation of  summarizing the identified root cause and providing a clear path forward.
