The trajectory details the arduous process of deploying the NutriTame application, initially to Vercel, then transitioning to Hostinger with a PHP/MySQL backend. The AI engineer and user Ray collaboratively debugged numerous issues across both frontend and backend. Key challenges included: persistent Vercel build failures due to  vs  conflicts and  dependency issues, which were eventually resolved via  and  modifications. On Hostinger, complex PHP routing was abandoned for a single multi-endpoint  due to server-level routing quirks. Local React build issues (caused by ) were also resolved. The final phase involved deploying the React frontend to Hostinger, encountering a conflict with WordPress's , leading to the React app being moved to a  subdirectory. The immediate problem is that while the frontend loads, interactive buttons are failing to connect to the backend.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a meal planning tool tailored for diabetics, featuring an AI Health Coach for personalized recommendations, a professional chat, restaurant search, and automated shopping list generation. It has evolved into a multi-tenant SaaS platform with Stripe subscription management and robust data isolation. Key completed features include: setting the launch date to October 1, 2025; robust profile management for all users; functional navigation; an improved AI Health Coach UI/UX with correct spacing, scrolling, and shopping list integration; a fixed medical disclaimer; an in-app Demo Countdown Timer with session tracking; and full mobile responsiveness. Future enhancements, such as an Advanced Meal Planning Wizard and Blood Sugar Tracking, are planned as in-app features.

-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, PHP (converted from FastAPI) backend, MySQL (converted from MongoDB).
-   **AI Integration**: Emergentintegrations for LLM.
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
-   **External APIs**: Google Places/Maps, USDA FoodData Central, Stripe API (planned).
-   **Authentication**: JWT.
-   **Deployment**: Vercel (attempted/abandoned), Hostinger (current target).
-   **Package Management**: npm, yarn.

-   
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the demo experience.
    -   **Changes**: Initially updated API calls to direct  files. Later, the  API call was updated to use the query parameter format: . This file was restored after accidental deletion.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Defines React project dependencies and build scripts.
    -   **Changes**:  for  and  were added to address Vercel build issues. All  references in  (start, build, test, vercel-build) were replaced with . The  dependency was removed from . The  version was corrected from  to  after being corrupted by .
-   
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment configuration.
    *   **Changes**:  was updated to  to point to the Hostinger PHP backend.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Configuration file for , which customizes Create React App.
    -   **Changes**: The file's contents were emptied to completely disable  and ensure  was used as intended, resolving Vercel deployment conflicts.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Central configuration for the PHP backend, handling database connection, API keys, and helper functions.
    -   **Changes**: Created and iteratively updated with Hostinger MySQL credentials (, , , ), , , , and . Database credentials required extensive debugging and user input for verification.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Initially an endpoint for demo configuration, it evolved into a multi-purpose API endpoint due to Hostinger's restrictive routing.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to use a  statement based on a  query parameter. It now handles  (demo settings),  (demo user creation, incorporating  logic),  (API usage stats),  (location data), and  (shopping list data). This centralization allowed various frontend features to access backend logic through a single, reliable URL.
-    (NEW)
    *   **Importance**: New directory created on Hostinger to specifically host the React frontend, separating it from the WordPress installation in .
    *   **Changes**: React build output (, , , ) was moved into this folder to allow  to serve the React app while  continued to serve WordPress.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving a frontend-backend connectivity issue for the NutriTame application, now fully deployed to Hostinger. The React frontend's static files (, , etc.) have been moved to  to resolve a conflict with an existing WordPress installation in . The PHP backend API is in , with all its functionality consolidated into  using query parameters (e.g., ).

The user confirmed that  now successfully loads the React app, including the medical disclaimer and landing page. However, interactive elements like the Start Free Demo Now button are not functioning. This indicates a problem with the React frontend's ability to communicate with the PHP backend API, potentially due to CORS issues, an incorrect API path, or the backend API not being properly accessible from the new frontend location. The AI has just asked the user to test a direct backend API endpoint () and to inspect the browser console for any errors when interacting with the non-functional buttons.

<optional_next_step>
Test direct backend API access and analyze browser console for frontend-backend communication errors.
