The previous AI engineer successfully brought the NutriTame application from an initial demo stage to a fully functional AI Health Coach feature. The work started with resolving critical deployment and display bugs, leading to a stable . The primary focus then shifted to implementing the AI Health Coach Refinement, which involved complex full-stack development. This included FastAPI backend (MongoDB, LLM integration, plan gating, 9 API endpoints) and React frontend (UI components for disclaimers, session history, limits, routing).

A critical navigation/routing bug emerged, preventing access to the AI Health Coach despite extensive implementation. The engineer meticulously debugged various routing configurations, disclaimer logic, and  interferences. A major breakthrough identified the root cause as a build system cache corruption, where source code changes were not reflecting in the deployed frontend build. The engineer systematically executed a build system reset, which involved clearing caches, reinstalling dependencies, and rebuilding the frontend. This resolved the blocking issue, making the AI Health Coach feature accessible. A minor backend URL configuration display issue was also identified and fixed during this process. The trajectory concludes with the AI Health Coach feature being fully accessible, pending further comprehensive testing and a new rollback checkpoint.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its initial phase fixed critical deployment and shopping list bugs, achieving . The core requirement is the AI Health Coach Refinement: transitioning from demo to a functional, gated, and compliant feature. This involves integrating real AI (Emergent LLM Key, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) for safe, diabetes-specific nutritional guidance, implementing plan gating (Standard: 10 consultations/month; Premium: unlimited, with upgrade modal), and saving conversation history per user with keyword search. Essential medical disclaimers (first-time modal, inline banner) are also required. The feature needs thorough testing and a  rollback point.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical build system cache corruption issue that was preventing the deployment of the fully implemented AI Health Coach feature. The frontend () and backend () code for the AI Health Coach, including AI integration, plan gating, session history, and disclaimers, were already complete. However, a build system problem caused the deployed application to use an outdated version of the code, resulting in navigation to the  route failing.
