The trajectory details the debugging and deployment of the NutriTame application, moving from initial Vercel failures to a Hostinger setup. The AI engineer and user Ray collaboratively worked through numerous frontend-backend connectivity issues. Initial challenges included resolving Vercel build conflicts and migrating the backend from FastAPI/MongoDB to PHP/MySQL. The core problem then became the React frontend's inability to communicate with the PHP backend on Hostinger, requiring corrections to  and API endpoint formats. Subsequently, the application struggled with correct demo mode rendering and state transitions after successful API calls. A persistent  in  related to function structure and try/catch blocks became a critical blocking issue, leading to user frustration and the request for this summary before forking the conversation.

<product_requirements>
The NutriTame application is a meal planning tool for diabetics, incorporating an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, and automated shopping list generation. It is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS platform with planned Stripe subscription management and robust data isolation. Key features implemented include: a launch date set for October 1, 2025; comprehensive user profile management; functional navigation; an enhanced AI Health Coach UI/UX with shopping list integration; a functional medical disclaimer; an in-app Demo Countdown Timer with session tracking; and full mobile responsiveness. Future planned features include an Advanced Meal Planning Wizard and Blood Sugar Tracking. The current development focus is on resolving critical frontend-backend connectivity and application flow issues to ensure the core demo experience functions correctly.

    -   **Importance**: Central configuration for the PHP backend, handling database connection, API keys, etc.
    -   **Changes**: Created and iteratively updated with Hostinger MySQL credentials, , , , and .
-   
    -   **Importance**: Evolved into a centralized multi-purpose API endpoint due to Hostinger's routing constraints.

<current_work>
The NutriTame application is deployed on Hostinger, with its React frontend served from  and the PHP backend API from . Core frontend-backend connectivity issues were resolved by correcting  in  to  and updating the fallback URL in . The  now correctly calls the consolidated PHP backend endpoint .

The application successfully loads the demo landing page after the medical disclaimer, and the Start Free Demo Now button triggers an API call that successfully creates a demo user, confirmed by an All premium features unlocked popup.

However, the application is currently facing a critical blocking issue: a persistent  in  during the  process on the user's desktop. The most recent error reported is . This error arose after multiple attempts to debug and restructure the  function (intended to set various states like , ,  after demo creation) and its surrounding  block. The constant loop of syntax errors, despite seemingly correct code snippets, has led to user frustration and a request for this summary to facilitate forking the conversation. The goal remains to ensure that after a demo user is created, the application correctly transitions from the demo landing page to the main app interface (e.g., profile setup form).
