The AI engineer iteratively addressed critical bugs in the NutriTame AI Health Coach. Initially, a PRODUCTION READY status was declared after resolving question persistence, profile data issues, and a no AI response regression. However, the user reported a new bug: profile not found on submission. This was traced to incorrect frontend logic (PUT instead of POST) for demo users and fixed by ensuring  correctly initiated a POST request for new demo profiles. Subsequently, the user reported the question persistence bug was *still* present. This led to multiple iterations, first attempting a  fix, then a zero-flicker solution initializing  directly from . The final, ongoing issue is a gated send bug where  prematurely calls the backend before disclaimer acceptance. This is due to  state synchronization issues, requiring manual QA for further debugging.

NutriTame is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its core feature is the AI Health Coach, a compliant, gated, and personalized nutritional guidance system using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, with conversation history and medical disclaimers. The app supports plan gating (Standard/Premium) and requires UI/UX polish, accessibility, and compliant microcopy.

Initial development focused on resolving three critical UX/data persistence bugs:
1.  **Question Persistence:** Retain and auto-submit user questions after disclaimer acceptance.
2.  **Profile Data Persistence:** Ensure onboarding profile data is available to the AI Coach.
3.  **Send Regression:** Fix the no AI response issue after retyping and sending.

The application also needed robust backend stability, no frontend regressions, rollback checkpoints for fixes, and detailed validation. The  declared the app PRODUCTION READY after the initial set of bugs were resolved. However, the subsequent trajectory introduced new bugs and re-surfaced old ones, leading to further iterative fixes.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend, managing API routes and MongoDB interactions. Critical for enforcing disclaimer acceptance, user profile management, and AI responses.
    -   **Summary of changes**: No direct code changes were made to  in this trajectory, but its API behavior (e.g., 404 for missing users, 403 for unaccepted disclaimers) was central to diagnosing frontend bugs.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, orchestrating global state, routing, AI Coach UI, and API calls. This file contains the bulk of the application's frontend logic and state management.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Numerous and significant modifications across the trajectory:
        *   ****: Updated to call  with consistent  (from ), resolving initial 403 errors. Later, modified to ensure it explicitly does *not* clear input or  data.
        *   **Profile Submission Logic ()**: Modified to differentiate between demo users (requiring POST ) and existing users (requiring PUT ). The  check was refined, and  was added on successful profile creation to synchronize user IDs.
        *   **Demo Access Endpoint**: Corrected  to  in .
        *   **Question Persistence (, )**:
            *   Introduced   to track user edits, preventing unintended auto-restoration.
            *   Changed  initialization from  to directly  to achieve **zero-flicker** restoration on mount.
            *   Modified  handler for  to update  and set .
            *   Updated  hooks in  to restore  from  or  only if .
            *   Ensured  and  happen only after a successful message send (2xx response).
        *   **Gated Send ()**:
            *   Introduced a hard gate: if  (aliased as ), it persists the question, sets  state, shows the disclaimer, and *returns early* without calling the backend or clearing input.
            *   Passed  and  as props from  to  for proper state access.
            *   Added extensive timestamped console logging for debugging state transitions and localStorage values.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving the Question Persistence bug, specifically addressing an issue where  was being called *before* the medical disclaimer was accepted, leading to premature backend calls and input clearing. This was identified as the gated send bug.

The work involved:
1.  **Implementing a Hard Gate in **: Added a conditional check () at the beginning of the  function. If the disclaimer is not accepted, the function now persists the current input to  and  state, triggers the disclaimer modal, and  without making an API call or clearing the input.
2.  **State Management Refinement**: Passed the  (disclaimer acknowledgement) state and  function down as props from the  component to the  component, ensuring  has access to the correct disclaimer status.
3.  **Local Storage Cleanup**: Ensured  is performed *only* after a successful message send (2xx API response).
4.  **Zero-Flicker Persistence**: Maintained the previous zero-flicker fix by initializing  directly from  and using a   flag to manage user edits versus auto-restoration.
5.  **Debugging**: Added extensive timestamped console logs to track the  flow,  state, and  values to diagnose the state synchronization issue.

The frontend testing agent reported that the hard gate was not triggering as expected, indicating that the  state was incorrectly  at the time  was called. The current work is at a point where manual QA is required to further debug this state synchronization problem and confirm the gated send fix. The  has been created, indicating this as a partially fixed bug with an outstanding edge case.
