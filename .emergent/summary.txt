The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's efforts to debug and deploy the NutriTame application, culminating in the implementation of the AI Health Coach feature. Initially, the AI resolved a critical blue page deployment error and a shopping list display bug by correcting property names in , establishing a stable  state. Deployment to Hostinger via manual file transfer was challenging, leading to a shift to a GitHub-based workflow after the user utilized a Save to GitHub feature due to authentication issues.

The primary task then shifted to refining the AI Health Coach. The AI engineer clarified detailed requirements for AI integration (Emergent LLM Key, guardrail prompt), plan gating (Standard/Premium tiers), MongoDB schema, disclaimers, and feature flags. The backend implementation was successfully completed, tested with an 84.6% pass rate, and incorporated real AI responses, plan limits, and database integration by heavily modifying  and .

Subsequently, the frontend for the AI Health Coach was implemented in , including service functions, state variables, and UI components like the disclaimer modal, consultation limit badge, upgrade modal, and session history. However, automated frontend testing revealed a critical navigation/routing issue, preventing users from accessing the AI Health Coach chat interface from the landing page. The conversation concludes with a request for a comprehensive summary to prepare for a new chat, with fixing this navigation issue as the immediate next priority.

The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its core features include an AI Health Coach, professional chat, restaurant search, automated shopping list generation, and Stripe integration. The initial problem involved a critical  (the blue page issue) preventing application build/deployment on Hostinger and a display bug in the shopping list feature ( to ,  to ). The goal was to ensure a seamless demo user flow, which was stabilized in , with deployment to Hostinger via GitHub.

The current primary requirement is the AI Health Coach Refinement. This involves replacing demo responses with real AI-generated nutrition guidance tailored for diabetics, ensuring responses are safe and general. It also mandates implementing plan gating (Standard: 10 consultations/month; Premium: unlimited), with an Upgrade to Premium modal. Conversation history must be saved per user with a simple keyword search. Disclaimers are crucial: a modal before first use and an inline banner in every new conversation. All features must be tested for stability, functionality, and lack of regressions, with a new rollback point created post-implementation.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation and initial testing of the AI Health Coach Refinement feature.

**Backend Implementation:** This phase was successfully completed and tested, achieving an 84.6% success rate in automated backend tests. Key achievements include:
-   **Real AI Integration**: Configured  with  and  to provide diabetes-specific nutritional guidance, incorporating a robust guardrail system prompt to ensure safe and appropriate responses.
-   **Plan Gating**: Implemented logic for Standard (10 consultations/month) and Premium (unlimited) plans, with monthly reset mechanisms. User profiles were updated with , , and  fields in MongoDB.
-   **Database Schema**: New MongoDB collections (, , , ) were defined and integrated to store all AI conversation data and user consent records.
-   **API Endpoints**: Nine dedicated  FastAPI endpoints were created for managing feature flags, disclaimer acceptance, consultation limits, creating/retrieving sessions, sending messages to the AI, fetching session messages, and searching conversation history.

**Frontend Implementation:** The corresponding frontend code in  was fully implemented to integrate with the new backend. This involved:
-   ****: A new set of service functions to handle all interactions with the  endpoints.
-   **State Management**: Extensive React  and  hooks were added to manage UI state related to disclaimer acceptance, consultation limits, AI sessions, search results, and feature flags.
-   **UI Components**: New UI elements were integrated, including a first-time disclaimer modal, an inline disclaimer banner for new conversations, a badge displaying remaining consultations for Standard users, an Upgrade to Premium modal, a session history panel with search functionality, and updated chat controls.

**Critical Issue Discovered:**
Automated frontend testing revealed a **critical navigation/routing problem**. After accepting the initial medical disclaimer, the application fails to navigate from the landing page (which correctly displays an AI Health Coach card) to the actual AI Health Coach chat interface. This means all the implemented frontend features for the AI Health Coach—such as the message input, send button, session history, consultation badges, and inline disclaimers—are currently inaccessible to users, despite the underlying backend being functional and the frontend code being complete.

The current state is: Backend is functional (84.6% test success), Frontend code is complete, but a critical navigation bug prevents user access to the new feature.
