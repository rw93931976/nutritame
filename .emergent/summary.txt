The trajectory details the AI engineer's comprehensive efforts to develop and debug the NutriTame application, specifically focusing on the AI Health Coach feature. Initially, the engineer resolved critical deployment and display bugs, establishing a stable . The primary task then shifted to implementing the AI Health Coach, which included complex backend (FastAPI, MongoDB, LLM integration, plan gating) and frontend (React, UI components for disclaimers, session history, limits) development.

A critical navigation/routing bug emerged, preventing access to the fully implemented AI Health Coach. The engineer systematically investigated, debugging various routing configurations, disclaimer logic, and  interferences. Despite numerous attempts and even a troubleshoot agent intervention, the issue persisted. A major breakthrough revealed the root cause: a **build system cache corruption**, where source code changes were not being incorporated into the deployed frontend build. The trajectory concludes with a detailed plan to perform a complete build system reset.

The NutriTame application is a SaaS meal planning tool for diabetics, targeting an October 2025 launch. Its initial phase addressed critical deployment ( / blue page) and shopping list display ( to ,  to ) bugs, achieving a stable  and establishing GitHub-based Hostinger deployment. The current core requirement is the AI Health Coach Refinement: transitioning from a demo to a fully functional, gated, and compliant feature. This involves integrating real AI (Emergent LLM Key, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) for safe, diabetes-specific nutritional guidance, implementing plan gating (Standard: 10 consultations/month; Premium: unlimited, with an Upgrade to Premium modal), and saving conversation history per user with keyword search. Essential medical disclaimers (first-time modal, inline banner) are also required. The entire feature needs thorough testing and a new  rollback point.

    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend, managing API routes, business logic, and MongoDB interactions. Critical for AI Health Coach functionality.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Extensively modified. New Pydantic models (, , , ) and helper functions (, ) were added for AI chat, user plans, and disclaimers. Nine new  endpoints were implemented for feature flags, disclaimer management, consultation limits, session handling, message sending, and conversation search. The  Pydantic model was updated to include , , and .

    -   **Importance**: The main React component, handling global state, routing, and the primary UI, including the AI Health Coach interface. This file has been the primary focus of recent development and debugging.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Heavily modified for AI Health Coach frontend integration and extensive routing/disclaimer debugging.  functions, / hooks were added for AI feature state management. UI components for disclaimer modal/banner, consultation limit badge, upgrade modal, session history, and search were integrated. Multiple attempts were made to define the  route using , , and  components, including creating  and  components, and  using  and . Disclaimer logic was adjusted to bypass global blocking for the  route. Numerous  statements were added for debugging purposes. Structural edits and cleanup were performed to address corrupted JSX and duplicate state declarations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the AI Health Coach Refinement feature. This involved a production-ready backend (84.6% test success) with nine API endpoints, real AI integration, plan gating, and MongoDB schema. The frontend code in  was also fully implemented, including , extensive state management, and UI components for disclaimer modals/banners, consultation limits, upgrade modals, session history, and search functionality.

However, a critical frontend navigation/routing issue was discovered: users could accept the initial disclaimer and see the AI Health Coach card on the landing page, but clicking it did not navigate to the actual chat interface, rendering the entire feature inaccessible. Extensive debugging efforts were undertaken, including:
1.  Attempting to define the  route within various  states.
2.  Creating  and  components with independent disclaimer handling.
3.  Modifying global disclaimer logic to prevent interference.
4.  Implementing  for card click navigation.
5.  Adding comprehensive  statements throughout the  file, , and  components.

A troubleshoot agent identified a React component lifecycle issue. Despite addressing this, the global disclaimer persisted, and debug messages from the modified  were still not appearing. A **critical discovery** was made: the build system (specifically ) was not incorporating the latest code changes. Evidence included identical build file hashes () being generated despite significant code modifications, and the absence of debug  statements from the source code in the compiled build output. This indicated a fundamental build cache corruption or a process failing to pick up the latest  version. The last action was an attempt to force a complete build system reset, which timed out.
