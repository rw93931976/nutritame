The AI engineer successfully completed a significant phase of the GlucoPlanner application's evolution, transforming it into a multi-tenant SaaS platform, rebranded as NutriTame. The primary focus of this trajectory was the comprehensive implementation of a Demo Mode and a global rebranding effort. The work involved: fixing a missing  environment variable, creating the  component, updating GlucoPlanner to NutriTame across key frontend files (, ) and backend logic ( for demo user emails), and adjusting  keys for persistence. After these modifications, the system underwent thorough backend and frontend testing, which identified and resolved additional React 19 compatibility issues and ensured the  and  functioned as expected. The session concluded with the Demo Mode being fully functional and production-ready, and a clear set of pending tasks outlined for subsequent development.

The NutriTame (formerly GlucoPlanner) app aims to be a comprehensive meal planning tool for diabetics, featuring an AI Health Coach, personalized profiles, and a professional, responsive chat interface. Initial requirements included an AI Health Coach with personalized recommendations, user profiles, real-time AI chat, and a professional medical design. Subsequent enhancements added restaurant search, improved UI/UX (color, chat window, clean AI responses), a shopping list generator, imperial measurements, API rate limiting, restaurant search bug fixes (display details, send to phone, map display, location accuracy), and advanced AI chat UI (auto-scroll, scroll-to-top/bottom, new chat in separate window, save, load, delete, favorite recipes, footer navigation).

The most recent major transformation involved building a SaaS platform with requirements for self-hosting, Stripe-based paywall with recurring subscriptions (Basic/Premium tiers, free trial), automated account creation/access, in-app subscription management, and multi-tenancy with data isolation. General requirements also covered scalability, security, low maintenance, and GDPR/HIPAA compliance. The specific task addressed in this trajectory was the Demo/Testing Mode to provide full feature access for testing without mandatory account creation pre-launch, while clearly indicating its future necessity.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was concluding a major SaaS transformation, integrating Stripe, building multi-tenancy, and a new authentication system. The frontend was experiencing a blank page issue, likely due to routing in . The user then requested a Demo/Testing Mode to allow full feature access pre-launch without an account, while indicating future mandatory account creation.

The AI engineer successfully implemented this Demo Mode and rebranded the application to NutriTame. This involved:
1.  **Backend Configuration**: Added  to  and fixed a formatting issue. Modified  to update the demo user email domain from glucoplanner.com to nutritame.com within the  endpoint.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation**: Created the new component  to display a banner during demo usage.
3.  **Branding Updates**: Replaced all occurrences of GlucoPlanner with NutriTame in  and extensively in . Updated  keys in  from  prefixes to  prefixes for saved chats and favorite recipes.
4.  **Demo Mode Integration in Frontend**: In , added imports for  and , introduced a  state and its handler, implemented logic to fetch the demo mode status from the backend, and integrated conditional rendering to display  and  when in demo mode.
5.  **Testing and Verification**: Restarted backend and frontend services. Utilized  and  to confirm the successful implementation of the demo mode, branding changes, and to address React 19 compatibility fixes.  was updated throughout the process.
The work concluded with the Demo Mode fully functional and the application successfully rebranded.
