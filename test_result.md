# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data.

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL AI HEALTH COACH FRONTEND ISSUE: Comprehensive testing reveals that while the medical disclaimer modal works correctly, the main AI Health Coach functionality is completely inaccessible through the UI. The application shows only a landing page with AI Health Coach card, but clicking it does not navigate to the actual chat interface. MISSING FUNCTIONALITY: (1) No AI chat interface with message input/send button, (2) No consultation limit badges showing 'X/10 consults left', (3) No inline disclaimer banner in conversations, (4) No session management (New Session, Sessions History buttons), (5) No search functionality, (6) No demo countdown timer visible, (7) Cannot test real AI integration or upgrade modal. The backend APIs are working but the frontend routing/navigation to AI Health Coach interface is broken. This is a critical navigation/routing issue preventing access to all implemented AI Health Coach features."

    message: "üéâ CRITICAL BUGS SUCCESSFULLY FIXED: After targeted investigation, found and fixed all 3 critical issues: (1) Question Persistence: Fixed timing issue where pendingQuestion state wasn't updated after disclaimer acceptance, (2) Profile Integration: Fixed routing issue where most app modes passed currentUser={null} instead of actual profile data, (3) Send Regression: Fixed multiple issues including hardcoded demo user ID, input clearing before send success, and insufficient error handling. All issues validated via manual testing. Backend confirmed 100% functional with profile integration working correctly."
