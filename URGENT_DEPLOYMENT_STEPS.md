# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Blue Page Issue

## **ROOT CAUSE**
Your Hostinger deployment has an old build that points to wrong API URLs.

## **IMMEDIATE STEPS (DO THESE NOW):**

### 1. Download New Build Files
- Navigate to `/app/frontend/build/` in this environment
- Download ALL files and folders in the `build` directory

### 2. Clear Hostinger Directory
- Go to Hostinger File Manager
- Navigate to `public_html/app/`
- **DELETE EVERYTHING** in the app folder

### 3. Upload New Build
- Upload ALL downloaded build files to `public_html/app/`
- Maintain the folder structure (static/js/, static/css/, etc.)

### 4. Test
- Visit `https://app.nutritame.com`
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to force refresh
- You should see the medical disclaimer (not blue page)

## **EXPECTED RESULT**
âœ… Consent form loads correctly
âœ… You can navigate: Disclaimer â†’ Landing â†’ Demo Landing â†’ Profile Form

## **IF STILL BLUE PAGE:**
- Open browser F12 â†’ Console tab
- Share any red error messages
- Check if JavaScript files are loading (Network tab)

**After this is working, I'll fix the AI chat and restaurant search APIs.**
